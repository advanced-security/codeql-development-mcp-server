        ## CodeQL Workshop Request

        Request a custom CodeQL query development workshop to be created from an existing production-grade query.
        The workshop will teach developers how to build the query incrementally using test-driven development.

  - type: input
    id: workshop-name
    attributes:
      label: Workshop Name
      description: Short name for the workshop (e.g., "dataflow-analysis-cpp", "find-sql-injection-java")
      placeholder: 'dataflow-analysis-cpp'
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: source-query
    attributes:
      label: Source Query
      description: |
        Provide either:
        - The full content of the production-ready CodeQL query (.ql file)
        - A public URL to the query file (e.g., GitHub raw URL)

        This should be a complete, tested query that you want to teach developers how to build.

      label: Source Query Unit Tests
      description: |
        Provide either:
        - The full content of test files (.qlref, .expected, test source code)
        - A public URL to the test directory
        - A description of test cases if tests don't exist yet

        Tests are essential for validating the workshop exercises and solutions.
