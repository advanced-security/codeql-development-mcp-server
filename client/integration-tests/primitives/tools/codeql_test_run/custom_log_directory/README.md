# Integration Test: `codeql_test_run/custom_log_directory`

## PURPOSE

This test validates that the custom `logDir` parameter is accepted and used correctly to store test execution logs in a dedicated directory.

## INPUTS

The following static files are used as inputs for this test:

- `./test-config.json`: Configuration file specifying the parameters for the test, including the custom `logDir` parameter set to `client/integration-tests/primitives/tools/codeql_test_run/custom_log_directory/after`
- Test files from `server/ql/javascript/examples/test/ExampleQuery1/`: Contains the test query and expected results

## OUTPUTS

Integration testing of the `codeql_test_run` MCP server tool will generate files in the `after/` directory (specified as `logDir`). The expected files include:

- `after/monitoring-state.json`: Expected monitoring state after the tool execution
- `after/evaluator-log.jsonl`: Raw list of structured JSON log lines from the test run (generated via `--evaluator-log` and `--tuple-counting` arguments)
- `after/ExampleQuery1.expected`: Pre-created expected results for the test query (copied from the test directory)
- `after/ExampleQuery1.actual`: Actual results generated by running the test query
- `after/test.log`: Detailed test execution log (generated via `--logdir` and `--verbosity=progress+` arguments)
- `after/timestamp`: Single line containing the timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) when the MCP server started the test run

Note: The actual content of log files will vary between runs, but the files should be present and non-empty. The test framework validates that the actual results match the expected results.
