## This repository standardizes on using the `codeql-pack.yml` file name
## -- instead of `qlpack.yml` -- for CodeQL packs. Either name is equally
## supported by CodeQL, but this repository chooses to use `codeql-pack.yml`
## as this is (we think) the long-term preferred name.
ignore:
  - '**/qlpack.yml'
  - '.github/**'

## The following `codeql-pack.yml` patterns are used by the `codeql pack ls`
## command to identify CodeQL packs in the repository. Each pack name must be
## unique across the entire repository.
provide:
  - 'server/ql/*/examples/src/codeql-pack.yml'
  - 'server/ql/*/examples/test/codeql-pack.yml'
  - 'server/ql/*/tools/src/codeql-pack.yml'
  - 'server/ql/*/tools/test/codeql-pack.yml'
